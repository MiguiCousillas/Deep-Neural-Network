# Deep-Neural-Network
This repository offers Python implementations for training deep neural networks (DNN) using NumPy. It includes functions for parameter initialization, forward and backward propagation, cost computation, and parameter updating. It also supports regularization methods like Dropout and L2, along with different optimizers such as momentum and ADAM.
